I am passionate about learning languages. I speak 6 languages at various levels. My current focus is on Russian and German.

I am interested in literature and writing. I took a course on creative writing at Concordia University [(CEJN116 Intro to Creative Writing)](https://www.concordia.ca/cce/courses/details.html?subject=CEJN&catalog_number=116) where I had a chance to work on different aspects of fiction writing like character development and dialogues. 

I am also interested in watercolour painting and graphic design. You may check out my portfolio [here](http://behance.net/didemdemirag).
