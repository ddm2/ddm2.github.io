I am a PhD candidate at [CIISE](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) advised by [Dr. Jeremy Clark](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/). I am interested in applied cryptography, secure multiparty computation and blockchain. I have also worked on projects related to stablecoins, genomic privacy, and privacy-preserving contact tracing. I am currently working on realizing secure function evaluation on blockchain.
