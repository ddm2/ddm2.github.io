I teach and design university-level courses. I hold a PhD in Information and Systems Engineering and a diploma in Graphic Design. I obtained my Ph.D. from [CIISE](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng.html), [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) and I was advised by [Dr. Jeremy Clark](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/). After that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [UQAM](https://uqam.ca/) under supervision of [Dr. SÃ©bastien Gambs](https://sebastiengambs.openum.ca). As a researcher in computer science, I work on projects related to data privacy, applied cryptography, and federated learning. As a graphic designer, I am interested in visual and scientific communication in order to present technical concepts in an accessible and engaging way. I enjoy creating logos, posters and brochures on a wide variety of topics. 

Take a look at my graphic design portfolio [here](http://behance.net/didemdemirag).
