I am a postdoctoral researcher at [UQAM](https://uqam.ca/). I obtained my Ph.D. at [CIISE](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) and I was advised by [Dr. Jeremy Clark](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/). I am interested in applied cryptography, secure multiparty computation and blockchain technologies. I have also worked on projects related to stablecoins, genomic privacy, privacy-preserving contact tracing, and privacy-preserving link prediction.
