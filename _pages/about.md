I am a postdoctoral researcher at [UQAM](https://uqam.ca/) and my supervisor is [Dr. SÃ©bastien Gambs](https://sebastiengambs.openum.ca). I obtained my Ph.D. from [CIISE](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/info-systems-eng.html), [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) and I was advised by [Dr. Jeremy Clark](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/). I am interested in applied cryptography, secure multiparty computation and blockchain technologies. I have also worked on projects related to stablecoins, genomic privacy, privacy-preserving contact tracing, and privacy-preserving link prediction.

I also create various designs and illustrations. You may check out my portfolio [here](http://behance.net/didemdemirag).
